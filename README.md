# turtlebot-project

It's a turtlebot3 project based on Robotis repositories.

I'm using ROS Noetic with Gym gazebo in a docker container.

We're training DQN and DDQN models to compare performance of both on simulation, and after testing the models on lab ("real").

In "models" there are some saved models that I got after training for 3000 or 5000 episodes.
